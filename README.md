# Elfsight PHP Home Task

Hi,

We're happy to welcome you to the next stage of our hiring process â€” the home task.

## The task
Implement the service which meets the requirements enlisted below.

### Functional
- A user can add a review for a Rick and Morty episode (the list of episodes are available via public [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-episodes)).
- An added review is being automatically rated (from 0 to 1) using the [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis).
- A user can retrieve an episode summary data which contains episode name, its release date, an average value of sentiment and top 3 reviews received.

### Non-functional

- A user can access a service via HTTP API.
- Its implemented with `PHP` and `Laravel`/`Symfony`.
- It uses either `MySQL`/`MariaDB` or `PostgreSQL`.
- Its free of bugs and works smoothly.
- _(recommended)_ It is covered with tests.

## Hints
- We're not asking you to implement the sentiment analysis by yourself rather encouraging use of a public API or an open-source utility you find suitable. 
- In the home task, we're not concerned about identity and access management. So, you can come up with a very basic implementation of authentication or skip it at all.

Please, don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions or in case you face an issue.

We wish you the best. Happy codding!

Elfsight Engineering Team.
